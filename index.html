        <h4>Why is healthy eating important?</h4>
        <img src='images/airways.png'class="img-rounded center-block" width="140">

        <h4>Healthy eating goes beyond reaching a healthy weight</h4>
        <img src='images/taking-med.jpeg'class="img-rounded center-block" width="140">
        </br><p>Healthy eating can also work as functional medicine, not just as a measure to control your weight. Put basically> if you want to be healthy, change your diet. Genes do not determine diseases on their own but function only by being activated, and nutrition plays a critical role in determining which genes are expressed. Equally, it has been proven that the nutrition of the mother, affects the foetus, and the nutrition of the foetus, goes on to effect the nutrition of their own offspring as foetuses. So there has never been a more crucial time to think about your diet.</p>

        <p> My name is Maureen O'Sullivan and I am currently conducting a PhD research project on the subject of treatment adherence in bronchiectasis. I am developing an intervention to improve patients' adherence to their treatment using behaviour change techniques that have been identified through qualitative analysis. The intervention is still in the early stages of development, but please contact me if you are interested in hearing more about my methods.</p>
